                <h1>Kenya</h1>
                <p>The earliest inhabitants of Kenya were hunter-gatherers but from about 2,000 BC herders 
                    came to the region. 
                    Then from about 800 AD Arabs sailed to Kenya. 
                    Some settled and intermarried and they created the Swahili culture along the coast.
                    The first European to reach Kenya was Vasco da Gama in 1498. Subsequently the
                     Portuguese dominated 
                    the coast of Kenya for 2 centuries. However they did not penetrate inland. 
                    Yet the Portuguese brought new crops to Kenya, maize and cassava.</p>
